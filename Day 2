SAME ORIGIN

 For URLs to have the same origin they must have the same protocol, domain and port.


The “Same Origin” policy states that:

if we have a reference to another window, e.g. a popup created by window.open or a window inside <iframe>, and that window comes from the same origin, then we have full access to that window.

otherwise, if it comes from another origin, then we can’t access the content of that window: variables, document, anything.
The only exception is location: we can change it (thus redirecting the user). But we cannot read the location (so we can’t see where the user is now, no information leak).

-----------------------In Action: Frame-----------------------

1. iframe.contentWindow: This property allows you to access the window object inside the <iframe>. You can use it to manipulate the contents of the iframe or perform actions within it.

var iframe = document.getElementById('myIframe');
var iframeWindow = iframe.contentWindow;
iframeWindow.alert('Hello from iframe!');


2.iframe.contentDocument: This property provides access to the document object inside the <iframe>. It is a shorter way to access the document within the iframe compared to iframe.contentWindow.document.

var iframe = document.getElementById('myIframe');
var iframeDocument = iframe.contentDocument;
var iframeBody = iframeDocument.body;

-----Windows on subdomains: document.domain---------------


Generally, two URLs with different domains have different origins, if the windows share the same second-level domain , e.g  borah.site.come, tsepo.site.com and site.com. their second-level domain is site.com.

we are able to make the browser ignore  so that that they can be treated like they can be treated like they are coming from the same origin for purpose of cross-window communication.

In order for it to work each window should run the code:
document.domain = 'site.com'

That’s all. Now they can interact without limitations

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<Iframe: wrong document pitfall>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
The "Wrong Document" pitfall in the context of <iframe> elements is a common issue that developers may encounter when trying to manipulate or 
access the content within an iframe, particularly when dealing with cross-origin iframes.
This pitfall arises because web browsers enforce a security policy known as the Same-Origin Policy, which restricts JavaScript interactions between documents from different origins (i.e., domains).

Here's what the "Wrong Document" pitfall entails:

Cross-Origin Limitations: If you have an iframe on your page that loads content from a different origin (i.e., a different domain), 
JavaScript running in the parent page (the main document) is generally not allowed to directly access or
manipulate the content within the iframe (the child document).

Access Denied Errors:
f you attempt to access the iframe's content using techniques like iframe.contentWindow or iframe.contentDocument when the iframe is from a different origin,
you may encounter "Access Denied" or "Permission Denied" errors.

Security Protections: This restriction is in place for security reasons to prevent malicious scripts from one domain from tampering with the content of another domain's iframe.

To work around this pitfall and enable communication between the parent document and the iframe from a different origin, you can use the postMessage API, which allows secure cross-origin communication. With postMessage, you can send messages and data between the parent and child documents, even if they are from different origins
